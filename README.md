## Product features

* **Christmas List** is a single page application that allows the user to create a list of gifts they wish to receive.

* The user can register their `username`, `email address`, and `password` following these validation rules:
* `Username` must be at least 3 characters in length and not greater than 30 characters in length.
* `Username` must contain only letters and numbers. No special characters.

* `Password` must be at least 8 characters in length and not greater than 32 characters in length.

* If the account is created, the user can log in to their Christmas list. Once logged in, the app will automati
cally syncs its `store` data with `localStorage` so it will remember the user even when the user refresh the pag
e.

* The user can seach for items they want to include in their list using the search panel.

## Direction for future development
* Allow people to discover a list by name, email, or link
* Suggest gift ideas based on people who include similar items in their list
* Add more API endpoints that the user can include products/services from their favorite stores
* _GIMMICK_: Counting down how many days to Christmas
* Once a viewer marks an idea reserved or purchased, everyone else (except the list maker) can see that status, avoiding duplicate gifts.
